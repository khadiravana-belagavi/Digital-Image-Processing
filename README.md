# Digital Image Processing

This repository contains all the Assignments done as a part of 'Digital Image Processing (DIP)' Course instructed by Dr. Ravi Kiran during the Spring 2020 Semester at IIIT-H. The goal of this course was to make oneself comfortable with how digital images are stored and processed on the computer and also get a feel of how an image would look like after going through some digital processing. I have committed the Problem Statements and Solution Notebooks in the appropriate Assignment directories.

Here is a brief description of each of the Assignments. Please check out the Problem Statements PDFs for a detailed understanding of the objectives of each of the Assignments.

- Assignment 1: Pixel Manipulation, Contrast Stretching, Bits Manipulation, Intensity Transformation, Histogram Equalization and Histogram Transformation
- Assignment 2: Edge Detection, High Boost Filtering, Laplacian of an image, Convolution, Bilateral Filters, Image Restoration, Linear Spatial Filters
- Assignment 3: Discrete Fourier Transform(DFT), Fast Fourier Transform(FFT), Low pass Filtering, High pass Filtering, Band pass Filtering, Spatial Sampling
- Assignment 4: Morphological Operations(erosion, dilation), Skeletonization of an image, Segregating organs of interest from CT Scan, Connected Components
